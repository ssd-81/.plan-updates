## Notes
### 100x devs
- Orientation
	- go slow if you really want to build depth. 
	- no need to try to hustle. slow burn and process. 
- HTML , CSS basics
	- tags, stuff , repllication



### backend engineering
#### HTTP servers in Go
- types of authentication 
	- password + id 
	- magic links (user has exclusive access to their mail)
	- 3rd party auth 
	- API keys (mainly for programmers)
- JWTs 
	- JSON Web Token
	- cryptographically signed JSON object 
	- once the server has created the token, it is not possible to make any changes to the token without letting the server know. 
	




### notes on behavior
- getting distracted by multiple things open on the screen. 
- trying to plan everything and not doing the thing at hand.
