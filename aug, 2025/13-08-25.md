## Todo
[ ] Review two pointer approach



## Topics
- Algorithms


## Notes
- Algorithms 
	- problem: reverse linked list
		- two approches to solve the same problem
			- recursive 
				- did not understand it even a bit; very confused and had a lot of questions. 
				- it went over my head. 

			- iterative
				- use two pointers to iterate through the linked list one step at a time. 
	- problem: merge two sorted linked list
		- this problem seemed very simple, but I am even having problems while getting this logic right. 
		- okay, so the problem is not as simple as it seemed, it actually has a part that needs some understanding. we are required to create a new sorted linked list using the elements of the two provided sorted lists.
