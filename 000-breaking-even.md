## Breaking Even

- [x] zero 0x1
	- started : 23-08-25
	- a lot of distraction; focus quality is not really good, but I will at least try to complete this session
	- working on backend database related bugs, configs 
	- did gain some clarity and got some work done; brown noise does help btw
	- i do well when i keep the questions coming and constantly iterate
	- took a small 5 min break
	- working on something that is pushing me 
	- attained 3 hr mark
	- the journey has still not ended; the hard part is still there
	- just about to finish
	- completed: insanely productive session; solved problems that seemed really hard or felt will take 2-3 days
	- session rating : 8/10 
- [x] zero 0x2
	- started: 03-08-25
	- the start seems to be great; focus quality is pretty pretty good. 
	- I need to keep myself hydrated. 
	- My system started to behave very erratic; so had to break my session in between. I am not sure if I hallucinated or not. 
	- This is becoming a serious issue, I will need to resolve it. This is creating seroius problem. 
	- I lost a lot of my focus. 
	- But, let me try to finish what I started. 
	- did complete it, but it was partially broken in between, because the laptop really went berserk, I just was not able to figure out what was wrong. 
	- next day, it was working fine. 
	- session rating: 3/10
- [x] zero 0x3
	- started: 07-08-25
	- got a start; but not great; a start anyways though. 
	- focus quality is steady; I won't say terrific, but managable. 
	- a slight fall in quality
	- continuing anyways
	- I do fairly good; but the problem seems to be not having a concrete system/framework to focus for intensively for long period; i get distracted in between and i don't have a clear model of what is work and what is not. 
		- ::)
	- was able to come up with a solution that I felt I won't be able to do in this session. 
	- a few hiccups here and there; getting stable though. 
	- session rating: 6/10
- [x] zero 0x4
	- 08-09-25
	- about to start at 21:24
	- started; and onto a good start. I was able to grasp ideas which I was not able to with half baked efforts. 
	- feeling a bit sleepy at around 1:35 mark, should have taken some sleep during the day. I need to become a mathematician and highly optimized athlete. 
	- feeling very lethargic and tired; limited sleep has started to take a toll on me. 
	- could not complete the session as expected (missed mark by 20-25 min) and quality deteriorated too. 
	- session rating: 4/10
- [x] zero 0x5
	- 09-09-25
	- session started at 2122
	- very poor start; high distraction; low attention. 
	- still after 45-min I am still doing bs; reading random articles; day dreaming and what not. 
	- got a bit of focus; doing a bit of linux and interesting stuff. 
	- taking a light break in between for around 10-min to continue momentum. 
	- lost track of time, started day dreaming and planning way ahead; anyways (though I did gain a bit , a bit of value); let's get back on track
	- whenever I am trying to focus on a problem at hand; my brain starts to push unwanted stuff at me, that does not makes sense to me (bs like I will do that, complete that , make that etc etc; you can do everything, but first focus at the task at hand) 
	- I am starting to question my process; for past 1-2 days, the quality of focus has not been great; just enough; but consider it part of the process. 
	- 
- [x] zero 0x6
	- 10-09-25
	- started at 21:30
	- started working on backend related stuff (having been delaying for 2 days now); will be focusing on that for 2 hours 
	- again got distracted in between by bs and planning; back on track though. 
	- on track again; but I will iterate and keep refining this process. slow and steady. 
	- feeling really tired; taking a small break; going to hydrate. 
	- pre-emptive exit; feeling really tired. 
	- 3/10
- [x] zero 0x7
		- started at 2117; lied ,at 2122
	- 11-09-25
	- got to a fine start. 
	- planning to start a short video essay everyday to improve my communication skills and to push myself hard. 
	- this is the time to really do something like this; I know cringe; but who is saying that --
	- I actually might be able to complete this project today; if I am going to; then I will surely upload the video no matter how bad. 
	- Focus is pretty good; stable and fine till now. 
	- started working on algos, now; will be spending around 2 hrs on this. 
	- might take pre-emptive exit, but will try to get it done. 
	- session rating: 6/10.
- [x] zero 0x8
		- started at 2307 (late, I know)
	- onto a bit of unstable start; but anyways; I will try to figure out in the chaos. 
	- the focus was actually good; I am still around 90-min behind mark; but I would say,  I can go pretty strong. 
	- was irritable in between, because of some problem I had encountered while setting up the backend project, but I guess we do learn. 
	- will be trying to get 2-3 problems done; even using help, but getting the idea somewhat right. 
	- Lost focus in between, linkedin stuff; need to block time from now on, further sharpen this system. 
	- session rating: 6/10
- [x] zero 0x9
		- started at 2131
	- background noise detected. 
	- full distracted session today; using all gpt generated code to work on a rust project. 
	- getting into algorithms now; was engaging very passively till now. Let me now try to at least make these two hours worth. 
	- still distracted, not at all great. let's try to get things done. 
	- got somehow back on track. going good. 
	- session rating: 5/10
- [x] zero 0x10
	- 14-09-25
	- **started at**: 2210
	- going to read a bit of scott adams to prime myself. 
	- continuing to work on algorithms (after a bit of priming) 
	- I am not sure if I will be able to complete this session today or not; I am currently near the 1-1/4 mark. 2-3/4 remaining. Let's see. 
	- --- unchained ---
	- 15-09-25
	- started at : 2200
	- did some work on golang http server; the quality of focus was pretty poor and bad. 
	- deep brown noise activated .
	- my brain is pushing to me bad ideas. observe and let it pass. 
	- feeling a heavy sense to quit. 
	- got distracted with twitter. 
	- the session is about to end. 
	- session rating: 3.5/ 10
- [x] zero 0x11
	- started 25-10-25; 1720 
	- core focus is to get mini miner; nothing else. 
	- started listening to music for some reason; broken focus. 
	- have gained a basic flow; started working on the problem with good enough focus. 
	- managed to complete the solution with a bit of help. 
	- did some random activity ; though not pure bs; but not really productive
	- got back on track; tried to read some docs; planned some experiments
	- there is around 30 min before the session ends; I have started getting heavily distracted; "Criminal" playing in background
	- completed , but last 1.5 h was quite inefficient. very inefficient. 
	- session rating: 4/10

	- kill 0x16; well deserved, but not justified
	- kill 0x17
	- kill 0x18 
	- about to end the session; fair amount of productivity; but realized how distracted my current state is; my efficiency could easily be 10x if I learn to handle chaos. 
	- done with the session.
