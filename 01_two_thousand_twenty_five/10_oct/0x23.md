# todo 
## what I expect
- do 3 sessions of 2 + hours each ; ideally clearing a bit of backlog'
	- auth, algorithms , mini miner , promises 
- vinland saga 
	- 180
- berserk 
	- 2 vol 
- martian 
	- 10%

## what I got done
- read vinland saga till 170
- read a chapter of martian
- solved one problem dsa; topic: arrays
- solved the auth problem 
# notes 
## algorithms 
- problem: rotating arrays
	- the idea of rotation is a bit unclear to me in the first place. 
	- the problem states we need to rotate the array k steps right; first I need to understand what rotation actually means . 


## backend engineering
### auth 
- I have been stuck on this problem for quite some time. 
- I need to get this done at any cost today. 
- opened the project finally after a really long haul. 
- malformed tokens; yeah, this things requires you to know what you are really doing. take you time to get the ideas right. 
- managed to solve the problem 


# afterthoughts
here's what you need to improve; 
- seek objectivity 
- focus on one thing at a time. try to close all the tabs. 
- drink plenty of water.
