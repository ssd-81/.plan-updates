## notes
### algorithms
- getting started with the session a bit late. 
- concept: reviewing adjacency list 
	- a fairly common problem (or meta problem) while dealing with graph algorithms is constructing hash map for adjacency list using edge list. 
	- adj. list seem like a pretty good data structure for storing directed graphs. 
	> **keep in mind that graphs are a fairly big topic and it takes time and patience to build a good enough understanding of them**
- problem: course schedule
	- After reading through the problem statement, I feel that I am required to check if their exists a cycle in the graph. 
	- I am not sure why we are given num of courses; how can I use that. 
	- I am writing a really bad brute force solution, which just checks for direct cycle and ignores transitive cycles; passed 18/26; will need to make some serious changes. 
	- checking for cycles using dfs style approach will lead to a highly inefficient approach. 
	- I am not sure if I can write a good iterative solution for this problem. 
	- is number of courses given as an argument is a hint; think if you can use it somehow 
	- moving on with the solution, now. 
	- got distracted a lot in between . not focusing with clear intention and sharpness. 
	- going through the solution, my line of thinking was pretty accurate and to the point; I just need to sharpen it and need to make it clearer. 
	- I am copying the solution side-by-side, but I will try to explain to myself what each step does and try to reason it myself:
		- we create a preMap which is just a dict of len same as num of courses; right not, we have not initialized the course req for each key in premap; they are just empty for now. 
		- then iterate through the list of crs, req => we are likely doing this to construct the preMap.
		- that was right, but it was very trivial. 
		- we create a visitSet , which essentially allows us to keep checking if we have entered a cycle while doing dfs. 
		- I am going to try to write the solution myself ; just going to take 5-min; its 2329. 


### backend 
#### HTTP Servers in Go
- JSON
	- continuing work on handling JSON data; we have already worked on encoding and decoding. 
	- found a pretty interesting question with a not so expected answer: ![[Pasted image 20250920192946.png]]

	- got to understand which keys are parsed and why by json. 
	- 

### systems thinking
- starting my long session with a bit of systems thinking. going to read this for around 10-15 min to prime. 
- systems oriented mean to play the infinite game. 
- affirmations: the unexpected seed.
