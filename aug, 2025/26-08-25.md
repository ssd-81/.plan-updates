## Notes
- Algorithms 
	- concept: insertion sort (continued)
		- tried to implement insertion sort. this is taking me some time; and i am not really certain of fundamental logic. 
		- iterations are really important. 
		- i think i did the basic logic right, but now i need to make adjustment for presenting the solution. 
		- okay, so the code ran, and the solution was incorrect; but the solution is actually a good v0. 
		- i am seeing that the pair array is same in all of the sub sols. 
		- the basic solution did work; but the relative ordering is not maintained.  
		- pending; 
	- concept: merge sort
		- solving the subproblems
		- most commonly used sorting algorithm in production 
		- on hold. 
	- problem: merge k sorted list
		- foundational and challenging problem; give it serious thought and time.
