# .plan-updates
daily updates on what I am learning, building 
- the repo structure is somewhat random, and it is pretty intentional; the reason for creating this repo was not to showcase something great, but create a process that is full of mistakes , biases, wrong thinking, corrections, and whatever I can get hold of. 
- i plan to keep experimenting with the structure and daily logging system; the system is ever evolving. 
- i got inspiration to do this from john carmack (id plan updates)
