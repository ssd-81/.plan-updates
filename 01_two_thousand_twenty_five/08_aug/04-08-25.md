- SQL queries 
- SQL subqueries 
- Normalization


## Notes
- SQL queries
	- HAVING : use to apply conditions to groups formed after using group by clause in query

- SQL sub queries
	- a query within a query; meta !:
	- can be used to extract information from another table and then use it in another query; not really a great explanation, though. 
- Interesting to know
	- SQL is a full fledged programming language; although, it is often limited to querying databases, but it can be used as a proper language if needed. 

- Normalization
	- Types of mapping between entities in databases can be usually categorized into three types:
		- one to one
		- one to many
		- many to many
	- one to many is the most common type of relationship seen in most web applications

> Review for next day: what is normalization? give example of 1-1, 1-n and m-n relationships (think for some time).
