## Notes
- Normalization
	- In many to many relationships, we often need to create a third table which used primary keys from both table to map them without creating redundancy. 
	- The joining table used for many to many relationships often requrires unique constraints across two or more fields. 
	- There are mainly 4 normal forms we need to focus on : 1NF, 2NF , 3NF and BCNF
		- each normal form builds upon the previous normal form (for example; 2nf requires table to be in 1nf ). 
		- successive normal forms implement more strict measures to reduce redundancy and increase data integrity. 
		- the core idea that I need to focus on as a developer is to check if we are introducing duplicacy; everything else can be ignored or be learned when required. 
	- It is not really worth to remember the normal forms from a practical perspective; the better way would be to keep in mind some of these ideas as principles: 
		- every table should have a primary key. 
		- avoid duplicate data. 
		- avoid storing data that is completely dependent on other data, rather generate it on the fly. 
		- keep the schema as simple as you can.
