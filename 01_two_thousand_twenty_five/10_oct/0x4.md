## notes 
### algorithms 
- problem: two sums II
	- seems like a good question; it essentially builds on top of two sum . 
	- going to give it just 15-mins. 
	- the input array is given in ascending order; how can I use this information; that is pretty interesting thing that I could use. 
	- the provided context in the question does not really help me; so I am just going to proceed with the core idea and will try to use it later. 
	- two approaches to keep in mind: optimized brute force and two pointers. must revisit 
- problem: 3 sum 
	- exceptionally good problem; spend some solid time to understand this problem.
