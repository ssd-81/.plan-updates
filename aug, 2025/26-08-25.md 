## Notes
- Algorithms 
	- concept: insertion sort (continued)
		- tried to implement insertion sort. this is taking me some time; and i am not really certain of fundamental logic. 
		- iterations are really important. 
		- i think i did the basic logic right, but now i need to make adjustment for presenting the solution. 
		- okay, so the code ran, and the solution was incorrect; but the solution is actually a good v0. 
		- i am seeing that the pair array is same in all of the sub sols. 
		- the basic solution did work; but the relative ordering is not maintained.  
		- pending
		- continued; checked the solution
		- hold
	- concept: merge sort
		- solving the subproblems
		- most commonly used sorting algorithm in production 
		- on hold.
		- continued; this gave some idea how to solve the merge k sorted list problem. 
		- merge sort code has two parts , the recursive call and the merge call (merging the two parts splitted)
		- if i really give this a thought, merge sort is pretty intuitive; but to really get the idea in the head; i must write a lot of code utilizing the approach.  
	- problem: merge k sorted list
		- foundational and challenging problem; give it serious thought and time. 
		- with respect to this problem; i do understand what i am supposed to do, but it is just difficult because i haven't done anything like that. 
		- but, i really think i should at least try this for 3 sessions before looking at the solution. 
		- priming is done; will be spending 3 sessions just trying to come up with a basic solution
			- just checked for a strategy, and doing 3 sessions (hard problem) without having a map is not a good investment
			- i will just jump to the solution after spending one more session.
