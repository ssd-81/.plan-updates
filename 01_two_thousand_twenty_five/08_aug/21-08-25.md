## Notes
- algorithms 
	- problem: 1472. Design browser history
		- problem likely to be solved using linked list; I am having a rough idea, but not really sure. 
		- I came up with a fairly basic approach, but it seems pretty good; even though I am not sure if it will work out. 
		- the first submitted solution did not pass; but it seems pretty close; some edge cases are not being handled properly. I need to check where the logic is going wrong. 
		- the core issue seems to be an off by one error; checked the code, seemed pretty fine; need to check for logic again. 
		- video solution
			- deconstruct the problem by constantly questioning and asking what is expected in the first place. 
			- almost the same process; but the solution I came up with lacked grace (edge case handling; practice and question) 
			- alternative approach
				- using two stack array based approach
				- lean and clean; but requires a better understanding (somewhat challenging)
	- concept: Queues
		- FIFO data structure
		- for maximum efficiency; linked list are better option for implementing queues rather than arrays. 
	- problem: 
	> edge case faltering is there; target for 70-80 problems before making judgements
