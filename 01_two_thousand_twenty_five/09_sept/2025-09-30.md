## todo/ logs
- [ ] unit 1 networking
- [ ] unit 1 ml
- [ ] auth 
- [ ] 2 problems + recursive 
- [ ] work on that problem 


## notes 
### backend 
#### HTTP servers in Go
- auth 
	- HTTP status codes 
	- 40x: related to payload sent by users
	- error related to password hashing and verification 
- error related to hashing
	- I am getting two different hashes for likely the same  password ; looking to find the bug in the code. 


### algorithms 
- problem: best time to buy and sell stocks 
	- the problem statement at first looks a bit trivial and relatively easy; but I am pretty sure this requires some bit of thinking that goes beyond the books. 
	- we also need to make sure either we make profit or make no loss. 
	- I am thinking of a brute force solution
		- find all the possible combinations of buy and sell
		- look for the highest profit combo
		- if there is no combo that gives us profit, simply return 0 or else return that profit 
	- brute force solution did work, but let me try a bit of optimization
	- This problem certainly builds a foundation for solving some tricky problems. Spend good time on this and try to extract the meta pattern. 
	- Two pointer approach 
		- L = buy 
		- R = sell 
		- my main question is how do decide whether to shift the left pointer or not. 
- problem (re): top k elements in the list
