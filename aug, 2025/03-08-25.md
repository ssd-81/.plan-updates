### Topics  
- SQL schema
- CRUD operations
- started CRUD project using postgreSQL 

### Notes  
-  what is schema? : blueprint of the database (the columns, data types, rows, constraints etc)
- what is a relational database in the first place?
    - data is stored so that each data point can be related to other data with ease
    - data is typically stored in the form of tables
    - each row in a relational table is called a record 
    - typically, each record has a unique id called primary key
- relational v non-relational databases
    - the fundamental difference is that nrd store data by nesting successively, rather than creating another table; they store records within other records 
    - non-relational databases come with their own flaws; the most important being, duplicacy. 
- CRUD
    - the bread and butter of every database.
    - CRUD operations map with HTTP methods like a glove. 
        - HTTP POST -> CREATE
        - HTTP GET -> READ
        - HTTP PUT -> UPDATE
        - HTTP DELETE -> DELETE
- HTTP CRUD lifecycle
    - it is very important to understand how the data flows through a web application; the gateway , the processing and the where it arrives finally

- Golang Postgres CLI project
    - installed postgres and checked if it is working properly
