## Notes 
- RSS project
	- continued working on integrating the sqlc code to register the user
		- this is taking me more time than expected, but I will anyway stick to the process. 
		- using a struct to pass the user info for creating new entry in database; just experimenting with this; could be a good approach.
		- made some visible progress; but still the issue is prevalent and not resolved
		- i might need to change a major portion of code in main as it is not looking very scalable and even maintainable
	- making changes to structure in the program to reduce redundancy and increase maintainablity 	
		- stateData.Db write is leading to go compiler warning about not reading ; might need to make this global and not limited to the main
		- i am simple staring at code for quite some time just to make some sense out of it; i don't know how to really solve this, but i guess this is what we call learning
	- how to run the registered functions according to the command provided
		- i need to pass the command struct to the Run function; but I am not able to find it in the first place
	- dealing with vscode merge conflict
		- was resolved quite easily; but this problem was indirectly bugging me for quite some time. 
	- resolving command line argument parsing error and passing info to the command struct 
	- working on fixing pointer related problems causing changes locally , but not globally
		- resolved it; pointer was not the problem, but i was not writing changes at the os level ( i am not using the right words likely)
	- the register handler function is not executing completely or some functionality is broken
		- analyzing the handlerRegister function by setting various print command in between to find where the function is acting strange
		- got some data (error) while the write command is being executed; something like the server is misbehaving: likely configuration fault
		- some progress was made; I am now not getting the tcp server misbehaving error
		- connection to the database has been made successfully. 
		- I had mistakenly made down migrations due to which the table I was interacting with does not exist in the database; but now there seems to be some other problem
		- I think too much, the problem was fairly basic; just had to check the connection string 
		- successfully made the first entry; cool !
	- change the login function to take up credentials from the users database
		- made changes in function to first make to a call to getUser function generated by sqlc
		- a minor bug is there in the login handler function; if the user does not exist, the logic works perfectly, but the error is not caught 
		- okay , so the problem seems to which function is handling the error raised by one of the functions; interesting stuff
		- i was not catching the error and was expecting to show up magically up in the console. 
		- same error is being logged in the console , but with slightly different formatting, one simple text and the other one with proper time and logging format. 
 
	- why doesn't the sql.Open give errors if the connection failed; it is quite confusing what is causing that 
		- it does give errors, I wasn't catching them properly
	- adding new commands: users
		- this command will retrieve all the users from the users table ; just a slight catch: mark the currently logged in user with some special sign
