### Algorithms 
- problem: min cost climbing stairs 
	- I am trying to visualize an approach and choose an appropriate data structure according to that. I am not having a clear map to solve this approach. 
	- I am not certain if I can directly write a recursive solution for this problem. I am unable to conceptualize a direct approach for this. I mean , I don't see a recursive nature for some reason, even though it is very likely this is recursive. 
	- did came up with an approach to solve this problem and had to understand a few underlying ideas of object oriented programming. 
	- solution 
		- I misunderstood a few critical ideas. Also, I missed out on critical details that lead to solution. 
		- It does not really matter if the language of the problem is not great, it your fault that you are not able to get it right. 
		- all three approaches are pretty interesting and great . I am going to visit this problem surely after a week.
