## Notes
- Backend 
    - rss feed aggregator project
      - okay, so I changed my setup in between (omarchy linux) and I forgot that all my files were configured on my previous setup; now I need to do the work from scratch. 
      - I guess it is going to take me a good amount of time. 
     - I figured out the setup pretty pretty easily; just got a hint of arch architecture and intent. long journey ahead though. 
     - continued working on rss feed adding feature 
        - I am trying to emulate the the existing functions to write the  current one.
