## todo/ logs
- [ ] 4 hour deep work session
- [ ] get ready for deep dive into backend engineering paradigm
	- setup books to really dive deep
	- follow elite engineers 
	- understand what separates elite engineering from mediocre
	- how can I join big leagues 
	- define a stack that I am going to focus on for 600-800 days


## notes

### backend engineering
#### HTTP servers in go
- workflows:  while working with servers is not the same as that we design a CLI app; a server works all the time, so the workflow while working with a server cannot be the same. 
- Custom handlers: 
	- an http.Handler is just an interface
	- the idea of custom handlers does not make a lot of sense for now; but they seem interesting. 
- Readiness endpoints: commonly used by external systems to check if our server is ready to receive traffic or not. 
- basic server configuration with custom handlers ![[Pasted image 20250916185826.png]]
- working on an assignments, that requires me to setup custom handlers; a lot of things I am doing are purely out of experimentation; I don't understand a lot of details , I am just try to make sense as I go along 

- stateful handlers: don't know what exactly are they; but from what I understand currently, these allow to store states that allow to access and store data while the server is running in a manner that does not corrupt (race condition) due to changes by different endpoints. 


### Algorithms
- problem (re:) : number of islands 
	- I did watch the solution yesterday; I am going to look at the solution and figure out a few critical logic errors that made the solution not pass. 
	- I took a look at the code, but it did not made much sense; I am not able to get the entire picture ; I am kind of guessing how things are working under the hood. 
	- I am starting to make sense out of this; it is not as difficult as it look like; but it is tremendously rewarding. 
	- there were a few typos, but in the process, I got a far better understanding of the problem.

- problem: max area of islands
	- area is defined as the number of cells within island; we need to return the maximum area of an island in the grid; if we don't find an island, return 0. 
	- this problem seems very similar to the previous problem I was working on. Let me give it a try for 15-20 min on my own, then I will take reference from that problem. 
	- I came up with a solution in the limited time, and it is not so bad; I mean, it looks quite close to me. Just yesterday, I was saying, this problem is too difficult for me. Follow the system, man; just follow the system. 
	- getting a scoping related error, which does not really makes sense to me; but let me do some Socratic questioning to grasp this idea. 
	- had to make changes to the function using `nonlocal` keyword in python; but the function is not giving output as expected. 
	- I now will try to compare the solution with the number of island solution and debug along the way:
