- Algorithms
	- Remove duplicates from sorted array (0(1) memory)  
		- the most difficult part about this problem was the condition that O(1) memory had to be used. 
		- learnt about 2 pointer approach, the approach that I was using seriously bad. 
			- just so that I am able to get better; here is what I was doing: I was essentially removing any duplicate by comparing the current idx value to previous idx value and break out of the loop so that the resizing caused side effects can be prevented. 
		- learn to read problem statements and understand the meta patterns that can be used to solve a problem. 
	- Remove element 
		- remove all occurences of val from the given array in place
		- this problem does seem to signal two pointer approach. 
		- I am getting a hang of the two pointer approach.
	 
> I have never really tried to stick to the process seriously for long enough, I last tried to solve this problem almost 1 month back, but never looked back. I am going to build a system to at least do 1-2 problem every single day. I will build deep learning one step at a time.
