- Joins



## Notes
- Joins
	- Left join, right join, full join
		- better to google than define, not really required to learn. 
		- joins are mostly about practice; you get better at using them once you are familiar with the patterns. 
	- Multiple joins
		- if we require data from multiple tables, queries can be merged.
