## todo/ logs
- [x] do the 2 session properly
- [x] add systems bit


## notes
### algorithms
- problem: house robber
	- we cannot rob two adjacent houses (this is the most critical piece of information)
	- 15-min intensive thinking: 1811 -> 1826
	- I can't really think without writing code, I have a basic structure in mind, but without testing it with writing code, it is very raw. 
	- tried to write a code, the idea was very abstract, but it was not well analyzed. 
	- done with the basic iteration step; I will now heavily focus on getting this right. In the remaining time of this session, I will just try to get to workable solution. 
	- I think I am trying to directly jump to the harder solution; I should first try to just get the basic recursive function right, then I just have to memoize it; and finally , convert it into bottom up. 
	- I did managed to pass a lot of cases somehow, but I still think I am lacking a core understanding of the idea; also, I have not solved the problem in its entirety. 
	- so, I think my approach might be having a fair amount of problems, I have not really assessed the problem sufficiently and properly. 
	- solution
		- mark this question as absolutely fundamental; this is a brilliant question to understand dynamic programming. 
		- it is all about finding sub-problems to work on . 
		- the code solution for this problem was so simple, but the underlying idea is immensely valuable; this is a terrific problem to get the fundamentals right. 
	- I am going to watch the solution once again and try to understand the meta pattern of this idea; even though, I don't understand the core for now. 
	- I am sensing the meta pattern, but not completely sure for now.

- concept: 2D dynamic programming 
	- what is the difference between top-down dynamic programming and bottom-up DP? how do we know which is what; also to what extent are these applicable? 
	- a good problem to understand the 2D DP idea, is count paths problem; this problem requires us to find all possible paths that exist in a grid from (0,0) to right most cell and we are limited to two options at each point, either go down or go right. 
	- problem to understand 2D DP
		- essentially, the count paths problem is not much different from the standard 1D problems we tried, just that we need to increase context window to keep in mind the other factors. 
### backend engineering
#### HTTP Servers in Go
- writing code for filtering words and making changes to the input sent in request. 
- I have to add helper functions for handling validate_chirp endpoint; I am putting that task on hold for now. 
- Storage
	- storage is one of the most important ideas related to web applications. 
	- we have mainly two ways to store data:
		- raw data (like .json); this generates a large amount of problems really fast. concurrency, scalability and complexity; all take over real fast. 
		- database: these look like simple piece of technology; but they are kind of goated. Without database, persistent storage would be really difficult, especially at scale. 
	- did setup postgres, goose and sqlc for handling database related functionality in my project. 
- CreateUser api handler
	- we are required to build an API handler for storing data in the database. 
	- what is this context.Context() that is passed in almost every db query or anything remotely related to databases in go.

### systems
- when you don't know anything about a particular topic, it's easy to assume it would be too hard to learn it quickly. 
	- the way to handle this is simply ask questions; I know this does not always solve the problem, but it is the best bet for actually getting started and for that matter, even doing it. asking questions reveals a lot of things; our assumptions are removed and we need to confront with real data.
