## Topics
- Backend engineering
	- setting up database migrations
	- establishing connection with database


## Notes
- Backend 
	- goose setup 
	- tested for up and down migrations using goose 
	- setup SQLC
		- kind of like an ORM, but not exactly an ORM
		- a tool to write Go code using SQL queries
		- write SQL queries and test go code generation 
		- install postgres driver for communication between program and database
	- setting up database connection in the code using config files 
	- stuck in a circular dependency; will need to fix this and it might take some time
> I was getting a bit distracted while working on SQLC setup and testing go code generation using SQLC; I don't know, but I guess momentum and conditioning are more real than I thought. 

> I am not able to work with my full focus, but I won't quit; I need to keep pushing the 469 metric.
