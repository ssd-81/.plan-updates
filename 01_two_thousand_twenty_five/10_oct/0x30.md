## backend engineering 
- auth
	- continuing to work on the server; also need to check for error codes specifically for accessing logged in endpoints using the JWT
	- asked chatgpt to read a lot of code for me; so I skipped the hard part to great extent. 
	- I am not doing the heavy lifting , that is actually where the real work happens; reading code end to end and figuring out what is causing the problem. 
- starting a 4 hour session
	- what does jwt being stateless mean? 
	- server does not need to maintain which user are logged in via jwt. their value is fine without having the info . this is pretty bad . i ought to understand this better. 
	- one way to define statlessness is not having to access the database. 
	- **why do refresh tokens exist**? 
- refresh tokens
