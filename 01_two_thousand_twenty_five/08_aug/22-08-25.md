		- fixing dependency problem 
			- i have restructured the code and the error with circular dependency has been fixed, but i need to figure how to use the sqlc code in the handler functions
		- i am stuck with a problem that is hardly moving and it seems pretty difficult
			- first step: define the problem in clear words. 
				- i need to create a handler function for handling registration of users
				- all the handler functions are defined in the cli package; all packages take as parameter the state variable which stores the essential information related to the current run
				- i need to find out how to use the sqlc code in the handlerRegister function using the state parameter and then register the user successfully
			 	> i think i need to read the sqlc docs to understand this problem better.
				> i got a bit distracted with achievements of people on linkedin, get back to work
			- second step: think hard and write anything related to problem ; target at least 8 y before anything else
				- looking at the users.sql.go code generated by sqlc; don't know how the args will be passed to it
				- something called context.Background() came up, and i need to pass it as an arg to state.Db.GetUser() as one of the argument
				-
