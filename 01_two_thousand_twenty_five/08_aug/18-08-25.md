## Todo/Logs
- Solve 5 algorithmic problems
- solve circular dependency issue due to state struct

- Logs: x : 0 ; y : 3

## Topics
- backend engineering with golang
- rust development


## Notes
- backend engineering
	- solving the circular dependency issue due to state struct present in the config package 
		- tried to transport state struct in the main.go file, but it lead to further problems. looking for a solution that is scalable and does the work. 
		- planning to create a new package for storing common components that are being used in multiple packages and files
		- created a new package named types for storing common 
		- seems like I did solve it; I guess we can only find out and create a better solution when more problems occur. Let's go!
	- register handler and register it with commands
		- need to understand the sqlc usage and connect it in the required places. 
		- will be diving into the documentation


- rust development
	- continued working on unit 02 ; guessing game
		- Cargo.lock file is created the first time we run to handle reproducible builds and highly maintainable and coherant code. 
		- `cargo update` ignores the Cargo.lock file
