# afterthoughts

I keep thinking of creating a perfect time; but that never exists. just start learning from whatever short time you have got. the only ones who utilize the bare minimum can expect to become masters. 
there is no perfect timing. you got a 15 min block; just start working; if situation doesn't permit, stop after 15-min , if not , just continue doing that.
