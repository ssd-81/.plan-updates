## Todo/Logs
- read rust book and write programs
- logs: x: 0; y:4

## Topics
- Rust development
> There was no internet today, so focused myself on rust entirely 



## Notes
- Rust 
	- Rust is a language for systems programming. 
	- systems programming: os, media codecs , memory management, implementing higher level programming language, networking etc
	- rust macros
		- a way to write code that extends Rust syntax (!) 
		- println!() => this is a macro and not a simple function. 
	- everything is a tradeoff in language design
	- Cargo
		- it is rust's build system and package manager.
		- libraries that code needs :=> dependencies
		- `cargo new hello_cargo` : this line creates a new directory and a project called hello-cargo
		- in rust, packages of code is termed as **crates**
		- `cargo check` : very useful while building and much faster than `cargo build`
		- summary:
			- `cargo new`: create a project
			- `cargo build`: build a project 
			- `cargo run`: build and run a project in the same step
			- `cargo check`: build a project without producing a binary to check for errors
			- cargo stores the result of the build in the target/debug directory, rather than the same directory. 
		- buliding for release
			- `cargo build --release` => compiles code with optimizations for deployment
			- executable for release build is saved in target/release
		- common setup commands for rust project
			- `git clone ----`
			- `cd someproject`
			- `cargo build`

	- Guessing game
		- `io::stdin()`
       `.read_line(&mut guess)`
       `.expect("Failed to read line");`
	 	- what does the above expect run; I am not able to find a specific case where it could be activated. 
		- io library comes from the standard library known as std
		- rust has a set of items that it brings to every program (prelude) 
		- in rust, variables are immutable by default. 
		- **associated function** : a function that is implemented on a type 		
		- references are also immutable by default like 
		- *enumeration* : type that can hold value out of multiple possible states; each possible state is called a variant. 
		- binary crate vs library crate in rust 
		- Cargo.lock ensures reproducible builds
