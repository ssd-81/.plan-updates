### algorithms
- problem : subset XOR sums 
	- was confusing XOR gate with NOR gate for some reason. but the confusion is clear now. 
	- how do I find all subsets; this is a meta question; which was supposed to be not be the focus likely. 
	- not at all feeling like doing any work. want to just time waste now. but I will just try to understand just two problems, well enough. even though I am not coming up with the solution. 
	- okay, for some reasons, this problem is not at all ordinary; the solution video is one of the longest I have seen. Let's see if I can learn something great.
