## notes
### algorithms 
- problem: valid palindrome II
	- need to check if a given string can be a palindrome by deleting **at most** one character. this is an interesting angle. 
	- I was thinking I just need to check characters at the end and the beginning, but any character can be deleted. 
	- unexpectedly wrote a perfect solution in first go. this was quite unexpected .
	- but I know this is not an optimal solution. 
	- solution
		- the solution mentions use of two pointers
		- this is going to be interesting. 
		- some interesting ideas used while writing the code; some things were not trivial and pretty pretty interesting. 
- problem: merge strings alternately
	- the name of the problem seems pretty perplexing; let's see what the problem really expects
	- got it done again; but again a bad solution. though I am getting a hang of this for sure; I have started to capture basic ideas and able to find some fine details. 
	- was pretty close to optimal solution, but I need to write a lot more code to get the hang of the core idea. 
- problem: linked list cycle detection 
	- wrote a basic function which was not even using the value of the node for the same; I am not sure if the value is even required.
