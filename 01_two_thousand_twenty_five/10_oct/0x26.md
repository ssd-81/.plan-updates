# todo 
## what I expect 
- algorithms (approx: 4.5h)
	- solve 3-4 problems in detail
	- review 2-3 problems and try to explain the solutions 
- backend (approx: 2h ; can exceed too)
	- solve the auth problem 
	- complete the auth segment
- vinland saga (approx: 1h)
	- read 10 chapters
- monster anime (approx: 45m)
	- try to do it when you are not distracted by anything else. 
- breaking even session 
	- restarting this path again; this is game changer if done right. 
	- do the mini miner challenge during this 
	- no need to focus on anything else. 

## what I got done 
- monster anime (did both the watching and analysis)
- did the 4 h session ; breaking even 
	- completed mini miner 
	- started a new challenge: unpacking
- nothing else went as planned.

N/A


# afterthoughts
doing a long session and then not doing anything is a truly bad idea. if you suffer from extremes; put the breaking even session at the end. do the essentials first.
