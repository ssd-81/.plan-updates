## todo
 - None; just do some focused work 




## topics
- algorithms 




## notes
- algorithms
	- problem: kth smallest node 
		- tried the problem earlier on 03 sept for around 45 min
		- did not pass the tests
		- watching the solution
			- the solution proposes the idea of using iterative approach to traverse a tree , which is the non trivial way, recursion is more common. 
		-  
	- problem: generated bst from inorder and preorder
		- I am not spending too much time on this problem; but jumping to the solutions really quickly , because it requires somewhat pre-reqs; I will be revisiting this problem again shortly once I get the concept right after watching the solution and trying to get the core right. 
> No real progress. Just tried to show up.
