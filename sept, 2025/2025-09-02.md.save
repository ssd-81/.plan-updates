## Todo/ Logs
- [ ] do dsa
- [ ] do backend engineering


## Topics
- algorithms



## notes 
- algorithms 
	- concept: depth first search 
		- just got a general idea; but actual understanding will be built through iterations and repetition
	- problem: binary tree inorder traversal
		- recursive solution is trivial, do it iteratively (mentioned  in question) 
		- i will try to solve this using recursion first. 
		- there is a mismatch between what i am trying to do and what the question expects me to do


- backend engineering
	- rss feed project 
		- addfeeds command added successfully
		- create many to many relationship between users and feeds

> got distracted , really distracted. I need to focus intensively, this is not going to cut it.
