# Learning Log: July 2025

## 01-07-2025
- generics in golang
	- constraints in generics (implemented using interfaces)


---


## 02-07-2025
- go design ideas
	- tradeoffs
	- idioms
	- principles
- introduction to http 
	- what are clients and servers? 
	- what are protocols? 
	- net/http go package
	- need for servers in the first place


---


## 03-07-2025
- http clients
	-JSON and handling in go
	- json.Unmarshal() , json.Decode()
	- XML 
	- map[string]interface{} 


---


## 06-07-2025
- DNS 
	- what is DNS and why it is used?
	- worked on a problem on boot.dev to apply unpack a response using Unmarshal and then use it to get required value


---


## 07-07-2025
- URL
       - URLs are actually URIs 
       - URNs are also a thing
       - URLs are asymmetrically used because of their practicality 
      - structure of a URL
      - query parameters


---


## 08-07-2025
- HTTP Headers 
    -what are HTTP headers and why are they required
    - meta information carried by http headers (client, os , lang etc) 
    - status codes (most common being 200)
    - fundamental idea behind auth (API keys and interaction)
- HTTP Methods
	- GET (a safe method, cause it doesn't alter state of the server)
		- get a representation (read: copy) of resource of site
		- how to perform GET requests in go?
			- http.Get
			- http.Client-> http.NewRequest->Do (verbose, but important)
		
	- CRUD (create, read , update, delete)
		- the core of all backend applications (quite literlly)
		- HTTP methods map to CRUD actions by conventions
	- POST method ( generally, not a safe method; as it can create duplicates)


---


## 09-07-2025
- HTTP methods
	- difference between GET and POST
	- concept of idempotence in context of methods
	- status codes
- HTTP PUT
	- PUT is used to update the target resource with the content of request body
	- PUT is idempotent (not like POST)
![post and put request comparison](/res/post_put.png)
- http.Client vs http.DefaultClient
	- http.Client is the standard way to handle communication between server, client and allows for fine tuning 
	- http.DefaultClient is fine for dirty requests, but can be problematic for requests where details are at play. 
- URL Paths
	- usually followed after the domain name part of the URL (or after port, if present)
	`http://mystaticstate.com/documents/hello.txt`
	- in the above url; the url path is /documents/hello.txt
	- static sites usually map the file path to the url path. dynamic sites usually don't handle that the same way. 

> The `http.Client` is a struct in the `net/http` package in Go, typically used as a pointer: `client := &http.Client{}`.

> I need to constantly remind myself that actually building deep understanding at something will take quie some time and energy. Let's not divert from the route; let's move one step at a time.

## 10-07-2025
- REST
	- architectural pattern for designing efficient APIs
	- design and best practices
	- general guidelines and not hardcore like protocol
- HTTPS
	- extension of HTTP
	- requeires TLS or SSL for encryption 
	- simply, http with built-in security
	- utilizes digital signatures to make sure the client is communicating with the server it is assuming it is requesting to

## 11-07-2025
- bugs v codes 
	- bugs is something in our code that is unexpected. the mechanism by which we intended something to work is not as expected. 
	- errors are very often expected; programmers' job is to fix errors gracefully. 
	- errors are at times unavoidable (example: no internet connection, remote server offline )
	- bugs need to be fixed; errors need to be handled. 
	- not handling error properly may result in bugs. 
> This is very much confusing to me at the moment; I just get a basic idea; clarity will be developed when I work on projects and ask many questions.

## 12-07-2025
- started working on pokedex cli project
	- did project setup and tested for basic utilities

- neetcode 
	- remove duplicates problem (hash usage, sliding window)
		- could not solve directly after spending 20-30 min
		- looked up the solution section for pre-reqs
		- realized that in place changes need some clarity to handle properly


---


## 13-07-2025
- pokedex CLI project
	- understanding of packages and did some structuring of projects
	- testing in golang
> I was feeling a bit under confident and did not felt like doing it; but I anyways spent an hour doing it without thinking too much and I ended 
> up doing it. Momentum is a very valuable thing; and I must protect it by putting in some fuel daily.

- None

## 15-07-2025
- None

## 16-07-2025
- Pokedex CLI project continued
	- worked on introducing the REPL functionality in the code
		- REPL is simply command like behavior of interpreting a command and acting based on the command (or make that seem to be the case)
 
	- introduced CliMap for efficiently storing commands and their callbacks. CliMap is a map which is a mapping from string to a struct used for specifically storing the data related to the commands
	- added help and exit commands to CliMap and tested 


---


## 17-07-2025
- Just looked at the code for sometime (not even an hour) => reason being; the problem I am working on is somewhat difficult , involves a lot of components. 
> This is a weakness of mine and one I need to fix badly. The real learning happens when you go through boredom to land on a solution after multiple
> iterations. Let's get up.

## 18-07-2025
- None
> This is not at all helpful. Asking questions and sitting with problems is very very important. Try not to break momentum. 


--- 


## 18-07-2025
- Continued working on the PokedexCLI project 
	- understanding how to retrieve data for pagination 

> Having difficulty while maintaining consistency. A core problem is being faced that needs to be resolved.

## 22-07-2025
- Did some questioning regarding the state of the code; questioned my process. 
- Pokedex CLI
	- how to introduce pagination
		- used structs to first define what we need to derive from the JSON and then unmarshalled the response as per the requirment
		> I have been stuck on this for quite some time, but that was out of laziness and not having proper approach. Will try to eradicate this.   
	- pagination
		- introduced forward and backward pagination
			- used config struct to store the prev and next url endpoint provided by the response from the api call to `"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/location-area/"`
> System redesign required. 
> Introduce paradigm shifts.
